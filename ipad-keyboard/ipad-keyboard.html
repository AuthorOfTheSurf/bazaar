    once recognized, however, that the symbols stood for letters, and
    having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret
    writings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted
    to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to
    say with some confidence that this symbol stood for E. As you are
    aware, E is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it
    predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one
    would expect to find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the
    first message four were the same, so it was reasonable to set this
    down as E. It is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a
    flag and in some cases not, but it was probable from the way in
    which the flags were distributed that they were used to break the
    sentence up into words. I accepted this as a hypothesis, and noted
    that E was represented by this symbol.
    But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of the
    English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any
    preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may
    be reversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I,
    N, S, H, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur.
    But T, A, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it
    would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was
    arrived at. I, therefore, waited for fresh material. In my second
    interview with Mr. Hilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other
    short sentences and one message, which appeared, since there was no
    flag, to be a single word. Here are the symbols. Now, in the single
    word I have already got the two Es coming second and fourth in a
    word of five letters. It might be sever, or lever, or never. There
    can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the
    most probable, and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply
    written by the lady. Accepting it as correct, we are now able to say
    that these symbols stand respectively for N, V, and R.</span></p>
