        <h1>CSS3 Transforms and Animations</h1>
        
        <p>Some of the most powerful features of the latest version
            of CSS can be found in its ability to <em>transform</em>
            and <em>animate</em> elements with very little code.
            You just state what you want, and an up-to-date,
            standards-compliant web browser will do the rest.</p>
        
        <h2>Transforms, Part 1</h2>
        
        <p>Simply put, you can rotate, scale, or translate (move)
            your elements with an immense degree of flexibility.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>For example,</li>
            <li>all of this page&rsquo;s <em>ul</em> elements</li>
            <li>are rotated by a full 180 degrees</li>
            <li>(with a little margin to inset them a bit)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Just remember that these features are still very much
            bleeding edge, so their properties will need to be
            prefixed with <em>&ndash;moz&ndash;</em> and
            <em>&ndash;webkit&ndash;</em>.</p>
        
        <p id="scale-demo">You can also scale elements.</p>
        
        <p id="combo-demo">And you can combine different
            transforms, too.</p>

        <p>Just make sure to mind your positions and sizes:
            elements occupy their <em>untransformed</em>
            areas on the page (note how the rotated element
            above this one is spilling over a bit).</p>
        
        <p>You will also need to mind the <em>transformation
            origin</em>, or the reference point for the
            transformations.  This defaults to the center of
            the element, but sometimes you will want to change
            it.  Look at how it affects the same rotation on
            these images (yes, transforms will apply to them
            too, just like any other element):</p>
        
        <div id="origin-demo">
            <img src="tictactoe.png" alt="A tic-tac-toe snapshot." />
            <img src="tictactoe.png" alt="A tic-tac-toe snapshot." />
            <img src="tictactoe.png" alt="A tic-tac-toe snapshot." />
        </div>
        
        <p>As you might expect, you can mix and match other styles:</p>
        
        <div id="transformed-box">Imagine the possibilities!</div>
        
        <h2>Animations, Part 1: Transitions</h2>
        
        <p>When an element&rsquo;s style changes from one to another,
            some style changes can be made smoothly.</p>
        
        <p>Imagine if
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms">all your
            links</a> behaved
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions">like this</a>.</p>

        <p>Effective transitions require some planning: you need to
            choose &ldquo;start&rdquo; and &ldquo;stop&rdquo; styles
            that go from one to the other in an appealing way (or not,
            if that is what you are after).</p>

        <p id="transform-transition-demo">And yes, transitions do work
            with transformations (hold the mouse button over this
            paragraph).</p>

        <p>Refer to the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions">transition
            specification</a> to see the full range of properties that
            can have animated transitions, plus additional options for
            customizing your transition effects.</p>
