        <h1>Advanced CSS3 Transforms and Animation</h1>
        
        <h2>Animations, Part 2: <em>Defined</em> Animations</h2>
        
        <p>Where transitions are <em>implicit</em>, meaning that they
            take place automatically when an element changes from one
            transitioned style to another, defined animations are
            <em>explicit</em>, meaning that you must state the
            animation steps that you would like to occur.</p>
        
        <p>This animation approach affords you more flexibility, but
            as with many technologies, flexibility comes in exchange
            for additional complexity or planning.</p>
        
        <p>To properly execute a defined animation, you must:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Plan your animation out beforehand.</li>
            <li>Determine the <em>keyframes</em> of the animation.</li>
            <li>Define these keyframes in CSS.</li>
            <li>Give that particular sequence a unique name.</li>
            <li>Finally, state whether some element is supposed to
                use a particular animation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The <a href="transforms3d-and-animation.css">CSS file</a>
            that is associated with sample page includes an animation
            called <code>'zigzag'</code>.  Take a quick look at it,
            then see if you can see how it corresponds to the box
            below:</p>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <div class="zigzagger">Whee!</div>
        </div>

        <p>The mechanics of defined animations consist of:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A <code>@keyframes</code> block that describes the
                “stops” in your animation.  Each stop is defined by
                another <code>{ }</code> block within the
                <code>@keyframes</code> block, prefixed the a
                percent value to indicate how far into the animation
                that stop should “take.”  The <code>@keyframes</code>
                block itself must have a name, between single quotes
                <code>' '</code>.</li>
            
            <li>Once this animation sequence is defined, you can
                then apply it to any CSS selector using the
                <code>animation-name</code> property.  Supply the
                desired <code>@keyframes</code> identifier and
                you’re done.</li>
            
            <li>The specific application of the animation can then
                be customized through properties such as
                <code>animation-duration</code>,
                <code>animation-iteration-count</code>,
                and a few others.  As usual, consult <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations">the
                [draft] specification</a> for more options.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note how powerful that last bullet is: <em>you can apply
            the animation to any CSS selector</em>.  You can see
            this at work below: look at the HTML and CSS to see
            how this one done...without repeating the
            <code>@keyframes</code> block!</p>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <img class="zigzagger" src="images/ex.png" alt="X" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <a class="zigzagger"
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations">Click<br/>
                me!</a>
        </div>
        
        <p>Just remember the usual caveat for a non-yet-final
            feature: you still need separate <code>-moz-</code>
            and <code>-webkit-</code> versions of these CSS
            properties for them to work in all of the major
            standards-compliant web browsers.</p>
        
        <h2>Transforms, Part 2</h2>
        
        <p>We end our survey of transforms and animation by adding
            a dimension to the web page — the third dimension!
            Yes, you can transform elements <em>in 3D space</em>.</p>
        
        <p>The trick?  Less tricky than you might think: there turn
            out to be additional transforms that you can specify
            in the <code>transform</code> which automatically
            occur in 3D space.  Typically, these are a matter of
            adding an axis (i.e., X, Y, or Z) to the transforms
            that you have already seen:</p>
        
        <div class="transform-3d-area">
            <span class="demo-3d-x">As</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-y">simple</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-xy">as</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-z">this.</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>But wait...that doesn’t look like 3D.  In fact, it is
            — by default, you have <em>isometric</em> 3D, i.e.,
            3D without perspective.  Think
            <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/_images/games/legacy/d12.jpg">Diablo 1</a>
            or <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d2/">2</a>, or, if
            you’re the nostalgic type,
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toSxQ3QHaTc">Zaxxon</a>.</p>
        
        <p>What if you <em>do</em> want perspective?  Simple:
            just add the <code>perspective</code> property.</p>
        
        <div class="transform-3d-area perspective-container">
            <span class="demo-3d-x">As</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-y">simple</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-xy">as</span>
            <span class="demo-3d-z">this.</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>There are a few more properties and capabilities that
            may interest you.  In addition to the official <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-3d-transforms/">3D
            Transform specification</a> from the W3C, this <a
            href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/">WebKit
            blog post</a> provides a good chunk of additional information,
            with accompanying examples.</p>
                
        <h3>One big caveat:</h3>
        
        <p>At the moment, 3D transforms are available on WebKit
            browsers only: that means Chrome and Safari,
            mostly.  Firefox?  <a
                href="http://www.screenr.com/JeRs">They’re
                working on it.</a></p>

        <p>But, I hope you’ll agree, this capability is just too
            much fun to wait on, so here we are.</p>
        
        <h3>And Finally...</h3>

        <p>As you might have already guessed, you can mix and
            match these CSS properties with anything else.
            Considering what has been discussed in this page,
            you just <em>know</em> what’s coming next.</p>

                <h1>A NEW HOPE</h1>
                <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire’s sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy…</p>
