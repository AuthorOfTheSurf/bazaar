        <h1>Advanced CSS3 Transforms and Animation</h1>
        
        <h2>Animations, Part 2: <em>Defined</em> Animations</h2>
        
        <p>Where transitions are <em>implicit</em>, meaning that they
            take place automatically when an element changes from one
            transitioned style to another, defined animations are
            <em>explicit</em>, meaning that you must state the
            animation steps that you would like to occur.</p>
        
        <p>This animation approach affords you more flexibility, but
            as with many technologies, flexibility comes in exchange
            for additional complexity or planning.</p>
        
        <p>To properly execute a defined animation, you must:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Plan your animation out beforehand.</li>
            <li>Determine the <em>keyframes</em> of the animation.</li>
            <li>Define these keyframes in CSS.</li>
            <li>Give that particular sequence a unique name.</li>
            <li>Finally, state whether some element is supposed to
                use a particular animation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The <a href="transforms3d-and-animation.css">CSS file</a>
            that is associated with sample page includes an animation
            called <code>'zigzag'</code>.  Take a quick look at it,
            then see if you can see how it corresponds to the box
            below:</p>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <div class="zigzagger">Whee!</div>
        </div>

        <p>The mechanics of defined animations consist of:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A <code>@keyframes</code> block that describes the
                “stops” in your animation.  Each stop is defined by
                another <code>{ }</code> block within the
                <code>@keyframes</code> block, prefixed the a
                percent value to indicate how far into the animation
                that stop should “take.”  The <code>@keyframes</code>
                block itself must have a name, between single quotes
                <code>' '</code>.</li>
            
            <li>Once this animation sequence is defined, you can
                then apply it to any CSS selector using the
                <code>animation-name</code> property.  Supply the
                desired <code>@keyframes</code> identifier and
                you’re done.</li>
            
            <li>The specific application of the animation can then
                be customized through properties such as
                <code>animation-duration</code>,
                <code>animation-iteration-count</code>,
                and a few others.  As usual, consult <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations">the
                [draft] specification</a> for more options.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Note how powerful that last bullet is: <em>you can apply
            the animation to any CSS selector</em>.  You can see
            this at work below: look at the HTML and CSS to see
            how this one done...without repeating the
            <code>@keyframes</code> block!</p>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <img class="zigzagger" src="ex.png" alt="X" />
        </div>
        
        <div class="defined-animation-area">
            <a class="zigzagger"
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations">Click<br/>
                me!</a>
        </div>
        
        <p>Just remember the usual caveat for a non-yet-final
            feature: you still need separate <code>-moz-</code>
            and <code>-webkit-</code> versions of these CSS
            properties for them to work in all of the major
            standards-compliant web browsers.</p>
